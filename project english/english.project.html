            <h2 class="h21"> the start </h2>
            <h2 class="h22">this movie is about a robot named rozum734 that ended up in a random
                forest, that originally lived in a robot cyber city.
                the robot used to help humans complete the missions humans gave the robot,
                the robot was like a servant for humans that could do anything.
                the robot tried helping creatures, just like it used to in its
                world, but there were only animals and the animals misunderstood
                and thought the robot was a threat. the robot eventually gave up
                and thought of a plan. the robot shut off and observed
                the animals "talking" and after a few months or years of observing, the robot
                had learned the animals way of communication.</h2>

            <h2 class="h21">the plot</h2>
            <h2 class="h22">after the robot understood the animals way of communication
                it could finnaly talk to the animals freely. one rainy night the robot
                ended up being chased by a bear and ran away, she ended up falling in some bushes and
                found an egg left alone, it took the egg and then a baby duck hatched.
                the duck thought the robot was its mother so it kept following the robot around.
                the robot got confused and tried to run away but the duck kept following the robot,
                and the duck accidentally fell and landed on some possums. the possums were
                arguing at eachother and didnt pay attention to the duck that was behind them, the possums
                mom (pinktail) had enough and and told the opposums to stop and then noticed the duck,
                the robot found pinktail with the duck, and pinktail and told the robot to tace care of the duck.
