    <h2>TV Girl is an American indie pop band from San Diego, California, consisting of Brad Petering, Jason Wyman, and Wyatt Harmon.[2][3]

        The band released its first three EPs in 2010 and a mixtape in 2012. It followed this with its debut album, French Exit, in 2014. Their second album, Who Really Cares, was released in 2016, with further albums following in 2018 (Death of a Party Girl) and 2023 (Grapes Upon the Vine), alongside collaborative albums and EPs.
        
        Starting in 2022, the band gained a following through the social media app TikTok. This led to a number of their songs, most notably "Lovers Rock" entering the charts in multiple countries throughout 2023, years after their initial release.
        TV Girl was formed in San Diego in 2010, by friends Trung Ngo and Brad Petering as a leisure activity with no particular ambition other than experimenting and hanging out.[5] That same year, the band released their self-titled debut EP, which attracted attention when they sampled Todd Rundgren's 1973 solo version of "Hello It's Me" on their song "If You Want It" from the EP,[6][7] leading to a takedown notice on the band, issued by Rhino Entertainment, who owns full rights to the Rundgren song.[8]

        In 2011, the band released their second EP of four tracks, Benny and the Jetts, along with a music video for "Baby You Were There" from the EP.[9] At the time of release, Joel Williams had also joined the band.[5]
        
        In April 2012, TV Girl released the single "I Wonder Who She's Kissing Now",[10] which would be part of their first mixtape The Wild, The Innocent, The TV Shuffle, released a month later. The mixtape was given away for free with an accompanying downloadable coloring book.[11][12] The release would have constituted their debut album, but according to Petering and Ngo the work was more appropriately defined as a mixtape.[2]
        
        In 2013, they released the single "She Smokes in Bed", which would be part of TV Girl's third EP Lonely Women.[13][14] That same year, TV Girl underwent a pivotal change when Ngo had left the band, leaving Petering as its sole member. Petering, formerly focused on beats, seamlessly embraced the role of primary vocalist following Ngo's departure. Soon thereafter, Jason Wyman and Wyatt Harmon joined forces with Petering.[5][15]</h2>
